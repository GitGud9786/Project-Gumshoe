# Project-Gumshoe
This project is focused on Object Oriented Programming and has been created as a submission for our third semester. The application is a tracker and collection of books, movies and TV shows that we read or watch from time to time.
Since it is often a desire for people to create a collection or to recover the progress of a long abandoned book or series, we figured this application can be an effective way to solve these issues.
The application still has a few bugs and limited database which we will be working on over time.
